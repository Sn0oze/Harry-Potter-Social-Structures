                            The focus of this project was to to take a closer look at the Harry potter universe using
                            social networks, sentiment analysis and word clouds. The Harry Potter series is one of the most popular
                            book and movies series in recent years and our goal was to use those tools to
                            gain new insights into known and loved material.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Several networks have been created to analyze the social structure of the Harry Potter universe.
                            A networks that maps out the relationships between most known characters that have lived throughout the
                            different eras ot the universe, was created based on the Harry Potter Fandom wiki.
                            Not only did the Wiki contain information about the relation ships between the characters, it also
                            provided some basic information such as the house, blood status and loyalties of each character.
                            In addition the Wiki network each movies were also turned into a network based on the character's
                            appearances in the same scenes, with the intention to capture the development of the social structure over time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In addition to the social structures we also extracted the essence of each book to illustrate the major plot lines
                            of the books.
                            Finally, the books and movies were analyzed for their sentiment
                            to show the mood of the series as if progresses towards the climax of the final battle between good and evil.

                    This section describes the network that was created from the fan Wiki to
                    map out The relationships between all characters that have lived throughout the different eras
                    in the Harry Potter universe.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The network was constructed by going through the pages of the wiki and for each page that belonged to a
                    character, the links to all other characters where collected.
                    The result was directed graph where each node is a character with edges to all other characters that where
                    referenced on the characters page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Wiki dump contains 15728 pages, but not all of the are dedicated for characters.
                    As there are no obvious identifiers for character pages
                    a <a href="https://www.hp-lexicon.org/characters/" target="_blank">list of (hopefully) all known characters</a>
                    was collected in order to identify the those pages that belong to characters.
                    After cleaning the list to ensure that the family pages weren't included and resolving some minor name miss
                    matches for a few characters the resulting graph contained 994 nodes and 7598 Edges
                </p>
                <p>
                    Information about the characters like the house, blood status and loyalties that were extracted from the
                    Wiki were used to color the nodes of the network and the degree of
                    the nodes where used to scale the size of the nodes to provide additional information

                    when coloring the nodes by house membership, the first things that catches the eye is the red and green center
                    of the network meaning that the most important nodes belong to either Gryffindor or Slytherin.
                    While the houses form some small clusters, they aren't strictly separated and have a fair amount of mixing.
                    While Gryffindors tend to be closer to the center of the class, the other house tend to be more towards the outer layer
                    also Slytherins a somewhat separated from Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs which a placed on the opposite side of the
                    outer layers.
                    It also a small fraction of the known characters that was actively part of the battle as the majority of the nodes
                    are not explicitly part of any of those fractions,
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the next graph, the coloring the nodes corresponds by good and evil. A character is defined as good if part of either the order of the phoenix
                    or Dumbledore's army while a character is considered evil if they are loyal to the Death Eaters or Lord Voldemort.
                    While there is large pure cluster of good characters on the west side of the network the two groups aren't very well
                    separated meaning that there is a fair bit of referencing across the two fractions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One thing that becomes apparent from those two graphs is the tendency that house and fraction (good and evil) membership
                    is not known or irrelevant for a fair portion of the network, which suggests that there is a lot more the the universe than the battle
                    against Voldemort.

                <p>
                    The graphs below illustrate the degree distribution of the characters. It shows that most of the characters have a very low degree
                    with only a few highly connected characters. The shape of the log transformed degree distribution indicates the presence of a power law
                    which is typical for a scale-free network such as social networks. It also appears that there is a linear correlation of the number of in and
                    out-going connections.

                    central characters to the Harry Potter universe and hopefully reveal som unexpected characters.
                    The following table show the most central characters according to various centrality measures.

            </table>
            <div class="section">
                <h4 class="center">Degree</h4>
                <p>
                    The degree analysis is concerned with the total number of edges connected of a node, thus indicating how connected a node is.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As expected Harry Potter is by far the most connected character in this analysis, being the main protagonist
                    he is the focus point in the story. The series is, for the majority, whitten in first person, and even with the
                    supplementary canon informations released through Pottermore, the Fantastic Beasts series and J.K. Rowling's personal
                    Twitter account, the information is mainly is giving through Harry’s perspective. To our surprise the following two most
                    connected nodes are Voldemort (Birth Name: Tom Riddle)  and Albus Dumbledore. This is of course because of their ties to
                    everything happening in the Wizarding universe during the Books series’ timespan. Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger then follow.
                    A surprising trend which will be seen through this analysis, is that Ron is more connected than Hermione. This in itself makes
                    sense as he a child of the Wizarding world, with a highly connected family, but a common conception of the story is Hermione
                    being vital to the success of Harry’s adventures. And while this analysis does not prove the truth of this conception,
                    it does show that her connections in the story may be affected by her blood connections within the Wizarding world.
                </p>
                <h4 class="center">In/out Degree Centrality</h4>
                <p>
                    In and out degree centrality lists the nodes ingoing edges (in degree centrality) and outgoing
                    edges (out degree centrality).
                </p>
                <p>
                    While the in degree centrality list mirrors that of the degree’s overall, the out degree centrality
                    supports the discussion of Ron being more connected due to his wizarding family. He has a large family
                    (even for the wizarding world) with embers in many of the stories communities, such as the ministry of
                    magic, the Order of the Phoenix and the triwizard tournament. Due to Dumbledore's wizarding lineage
                    and accomplishments he also rates high on this list, while Voldemort grew up in a muggle orphanage before
                    attending Hogwarts and discovering his wizarding powers.
                </p>
                <h4 class="center">Eigenvector centrality</h4>
                <p>
                    How much influence a nodes has on the network is estimated through eigenvector centrality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We may have expected Dumbledore to top this list, but yet again we find Harry there. This is likely
                    due to many of Dumbledore’s influential endeavours not being specified besides the acknowledgement of them being vast.
                    When studying the list it is clear that the most influential characters are those who have largely influences harry
                    and his journey, and not the overall story.
                </p>
                <h4 class="center">Betweenness centrality</h4>
                <p>
                    A central node has the most information passing through is, and is discovered through the betweenness
                    centrality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The surprising character in this list is Gellert Grindelwald who is a minor character to the
                    Harry Potter universe, but central to Dumbledore’s story. As his and Dumbledore’s youth adventures
                    dived into the story and existence of the deathly Hallows, this is most likely the reason for this
                    betweenness in the network.
                    Horace Slughorn, who is known for his networking with promising Students at Hogwarts and whom he expects to
                    grow into influential positions in the wizarding world, has both a high in degree and betweenness centrality, but isn't
                    present for the remaining measures. This suggest that Slughorn indeed has quite a good eye for promising students that fulfill their potential.
                    An other unexpected character on the list is Gwenog Jones who a Famous Quidditch player in the wizard world, but just a very minor character
                    in the books and movies. This suggestes that quite a few characters actively follow the Quidditch scene, the wizard worlds most popular sport.

                    <h2 class="center no_underline">Movie Networks</h2>
                    <p>
                        The goal of the wiki network was to get an impression of the composition and dimensions of
                        the whole harry potter universe. We will now take a closer look at the movie scripts as they cover
                        the universe's most central and well documented story lines and will see to which degree the structures
                        encountered in the movies align with the findings from the fan wiki.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The networks have been constructed by going through the movies scene by scene, tokenize the scenes into words and then
                        looked up the tokens in a dictionary that contained all first and last- and middle-names that could be used to identify unique characters.
                        The dictionary was constructed based on the before mentioned list of characters and also listed in the data sets. In some cases characters
                        could be identified by only part of their name such as Mr. or Mrs. Weasly. Those characters where identified separably by full string matches
                        within the scenes and required some deeper knowledge of the scripts.
                        Edges where added between all characters that where mentioned within the same scene. The resulting networks are undirected in contrast
                        to the Wiki network.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Like in the Wiki network, the size of the nodes is scaled according to the characters degree. Some minor characters that appear in only
                        one but fairly large scene with many characters, have inflated degree as a consequence. To account for the the size of the nodes
                        is also weighted by the number of scenes that a characters appears in.
                        The nodes are mainly colored according to their house membership based on character information that was also used in the Wiki network.
                        If no information about the house membership is unavailable, but the blood status is known, the characters a either marked as muggles or magical
                        beeings of some sort.
                    </p>
                    <p>Before we take a closer look at the networks of the each movie, let's look at the temporal aspect of the networks see how the networks
                        develop over time.

                            The first obvious difference between the movie and wiki networks the difference in size.
                            While the Wiki network has just a little under a 1000 nodes, the movie networks are far smaller
                            with something between roughly one-twentieth to one-tenth of the number of nodes.
                            The amount of characters in the movie dips towards the middle of the series and the increases towards
                            the end. The number of nodes and edges seem to correlate linearly except for the last movie where the
                            number of edges is noticeably higher compared to the other movies.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It shows that even though though there is a large variety of characters in the Harry Potter universe, only s small
                            fraction was given actual dialog or mentioned in the sanes either trough the dialog or in stage directions.
                        </p>

                    <p>
                        The high number of nodes in Deathly Hallows Part 1, is likely due to the requirement to connect
                        all the loose ends in the story. The book with the minimum number of nodes and edges is Goblet
                        of Fire, and is likely due to the very centered storyline around the Triwizard Tournament. This
                        tournament keeps the story focused on the school and the people present, and this changes as the
                        later book introduce outside groups such as the Order of the Phoenix.

                        One advantage of looking at the movies one at a time and turning them into networks is
                        that it allows to get an insight of the characters importance throughout the years.
                        The movies follow Harry and his companions from his first year at Hogwarts to the final Battle against
                        Lord Voldemort.
                        Now we can see when his closest companions or foes enter and leave the stage throughout the series.

                    <p>
                        The graphs below include each character that was among the top 20 connected nodes
                        in at least one movie and shows for how many movies the character was among the top 20 connected and how high the
                        degree was.
                        The goal is to illustrate which characters are most important for each movie, but also for the whole
                        Series.
                        The three main characters
                        Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger are the most relevant characters according to this
                        measure which comes to no surprise.
                        Many known characters appear in the top of the list, but it also captures many minor characters that
                        played a key role in only one movie like the participants of the Triwizard Tournament like Victor Krum and Cedric Diggory,
                        students who were petrified by the Basilisk like Colin Crevey, Professors in defenses against the dark arts like Quirrel,
                        Lockhardt, Remus Lupin and Mad-Eye Moody, or members of Dumbledore's army and the order of the phoenix who become more relevant
                        towards the end of the series like Luna Lovegood and Tonks.
                        Likewise enemies like Bellatrix Lestrange and Fenrir Grayback appear more towards the end after Vlodemort has been resurrected and
                        The fight against him moves towards the climax.

                    The network for Philosopher’s Stone illustrated the expected high involvement characters such as the
                    professors, students and Dursleys. The Gryffindors are highly represented as would be expected,
                    hardly matched by the Slytherins Snape and Draco Malfoy.

                    The three major characters Harry, Ron and Hermione, closely followed by the characters which are
                    early introduction in the movie; Dumbledore, McGonagall, Hagrid and so on. The network is quite
                    small compared to the later movies, but this is reflected in the necessity to introduce the whole
                    universe in a book, and too many characters may confuse the viewer. Its is from the beginning clear
                    that certain characters have been cut from the movie to achieve this. Peeves the poltergeist is an
                    example of one of these cut characters which are magical in the story but may be superficial in the
                    grand scheme of things. It is however noteworthy that many of these “simple” cuts and changes have
                    affected the later movies greatly as certain plotlines have needed modifying to make sense to the
                    audience.

                       shows that most nodes have a degree in the rage from 8-15 that look roughly normal
                       distributed around that range. Only a few characters have degrees in the range of 40-50.

                   this effect possibly could be explained by the small network sized alone.

                <p>
                    Three communities are identified in the first movie. Community 0 involves Harry’s family, his parents, aunt, uncle and cousin. Community 1 and 2 are hard to separate from each other, as none of them are unique. They both contain characters which are integral to the mission of the book, as well as side characters which are not. At first glance, Community 2 seems to contain nodes with a larger connection to Harry and the mission of the movie, with the exception a few tiny nodes, while few nodes from Community 1 are also connected to the mission. The distribution of known groups in the communities tries to help suggest connections between the characters.

                    Compared to the first movie, the trio is more prominent here. The significant size different in the
                    nodes, indicated that we are focusing more on the characters, while the number of nodes are also
                    increasing, with the introduction of new characters. McGonagall and Lockhart are the two prominent
                    professors in this book, with Lockhart being a new character. A character which was never introduced
                    in the series is the Librarian Mrs. Pince. Another new character is Colin Creevey who is quite
                    relevant to the storyline, being one of the petrified students. He is amon one of the larger nodes
                    alongside Ginny, Dumbledore and Voldemort. Another stand out node is Justin Finch-Fletchley a
                    muggle-born Hufflepuff who mistakenly rejects Harry’s attempted friendship when he mistakes him for
                    the Heir of Slytherin.

                    A total of five communities are identified in the second movie, indicating a more ambitious storyline and cast. Community 0 contains the absolute integral characters to the story, alongside a few minor, this continue the trend from the first movie, where unlikely characters are included in communities. Community 1 appears to revolve around the story of the Chamber of Secrets and Tom Riddle’s diary. Community 2 involves the nodes connected to the events in the beginning of the movie, at his Uncle’s place. Community 3 loosely covers the characters affected or connected to the basilisks petrification victims. Community 4 contains only, with the exception of one node, Quidditch players from the Gryffindor and Slytherin teams. Community 5 consists of primarily Gryffindor students.

                    The trio is in the third movie around the same node size as Sirius Black, closely followed by
                    Dumbledore, Wormtail (Peter Pettigrew), Hagrid and Neville. As the story revolves around the escape
                    and manhunt of Black, it is expected to have such a big node. The Slytherins besides Snape are not
                    the main rivalry in this this movie, and this is mirrored in the network. Voldemort is not directly
                    a prominent villain in the story as seen, however from the story we know that his venomosity is, for
                    the better part of the movie, mirrored in Black. Lupin is an unexpected result, as the varying
                    Defence Against the Dark Arts teachers tend to have a large impact on the story and seen with
                    Lockhart. However, his presence is largely felt.

                    Community 0 contains characters connected to the main storyline, such as the Marauders and Buckbeak. Community 1 contains the Weasley family and Voldemort, however the connection between them is not readily detectable. Community 2 involves the events at Harry’s Aunt and Uncle’s house, where he blows up his uncle’s sister. Community 3 is Hagrid and his trail for Buckbeak's life. Community 4 focuses on the nodes related to the everyday happening at Hogwarts, constructed of Gryffindor students and teachers.

                    In the Goblet of Fire the first significant difference seen in the sizes of hermione and ron’s node
                    sizes compared to Dumbledore, who surpasses them. Mad Eye Moody follows tightly alongside Cedric
                    Diggory. Though we see the final return of the Dark Lord, Voldemort is still comparatively small
                    compared to other key characters. The three other triwizard competitors are both new and highly
                    mentioned, as illustrated in the network, however considering the fascination with Fleur her node is
                    not as large as fx. Krum’s. Draco Malfoy and Snape are both Harry’s primary antagonists, in this
                    movie however this is not not the case, as focus is elsewhere.

                    Community 0  is related to Voldemort’s first reign of power, the people who supported him and those affected by his tyrony. Community 2 is not very specific, but overall contains all nodes relevant to the overall main story. It can be concluded that Community 1 is the main characters connected to the storyline of the triwizard tournament and new defence against the dark arts teacher, besides the trio. In Community 3 there is not apparent relation between the nodes, besides that they all fight on Harry’s side of the war and the nodes are not that important to the movies story, which differs from the book and therefore hints at the differences between the two.

                    As seen in Goblet of Fire, Order of the Phoenix have Dumbledore rivaling the appearance of Ron and
                    Hermione. Likely due to the fact of him being mentioned more often. In this movie we are introduced
                    to Professor Umbridge who is a delegate from the ministry of magic and has enormous impact on
                    Hogwarts and Harry. Voldemort is also more prominent, as Harry tried to convince the world of his
                    resurrection.

                    In Community 0 all the nodes work for the ministry of magic, but appear throughout the movie in different relations to Harry. Community 1 is the community of Dumbledore's Army (DA), which Harry starts as a studygroup to teach themselves what Umbridge will not. Bellatrix and Cedric are in this community, as Neville and Cho respectively mention them during their DA meetings. Community 2 involves the characters connected to Nagini's attack on Mr. Weasley at the ministry of magic. Community 3 concerns the characters involved in the storyline taking place at Harry's Aunt and Uncles place. Community 4 concerns the rivalry between the twins and Filch which is legendary in the books.

                <p>
                    In this movie we see Ginny emerge as a large node, this is because of her growing relationship with
                    Harry. We once again see Harry two antagonists grow in node size alongside Voldemort and Slughorn.
                    Slughorn is here introduced as the new teacher of Poisons, and reintroduces Hogwarts to his
                    Slugclub. The movie is largely dominated by Gryffindors and a small group of Slytherins.

                    In Community 0 characters are from the Slugclub, founded by Professor Slughorn to stay favorable with students with a promising future, and Slytherins. Community 1 groups Death Eaters, Order members and Diagonally shop owners, all of which fight on either side in the war between good and evil, which occurs in the wizarding world outside Hogwarts’ walls. Community 3 includes nodes connected to the school, the main nodes being Dumbledore, Slughorn and Voldemort, and the those related to them. Community 2 is the nodes connected to Harry's storyline.

                    The golden trio is dominating again, which is to be expected as a large portion of the movie
                    documents their solitary travels in a magical tent, hunting Horcruxes. Dumbledore and Voldemort
                    rivals about the attention as the later is an acute threat and the others reputation gets dragged
                    through the mud. The other large players consists largely of member s of the Order of the Phoenix.
                    With the largest cast, it is clear that the movie is setting up the final battle while attempting to
                    tie loose ends.

                    Community 0 represents the members of the Order of the Phoenix. In Community 1 the nodes are all involved in the break in at the ministry of magic. Community 2 illustrates the overlap in Dumbledore's story and the quest for the Horcruxes, the Deathly Hallows, and the trip to Luna's house. Community 3 follows Voldemort’s storyline throughout the movie, from the murder of professor Burbage to the kidnapping of Ollivander. In Community 4 we find mainly minor characters such as the Dursleys and low tier Voldemort followers. Community 5 contains nodes of students at Hogwarts.

                    Ginny, Neville and Seamus are stepping up at Hogwarts in the absence of the trio, alongside Luna and
                    Dean. This shows the importance and power of the DA (Dumbledore's Army). As expected Voldemort plays
                    a huge part in this movie, alongside his trusted Death Eaters. We can also glimpse the names of the
                    main characters offspring.

                    <p>
                        The word clouds show the most frequent words of each book that also are most unique for to that
                        book compared to the whole series. This is achieved by using TF-IDF which diminishes the weight
                        of frequent words based on the amount of other books they appears in.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As an example, the first word cloud from Philosopher’s Stone, words like “Fluffy” and “Flamel”
                        show as big letters, which means that these words are frequent and most unique to that
                        particular book. It provides a much better overview of the content of each book compared to a
                        word cloud that is generated for just the plain book text as all important characters would take
                        up most of the space for each book which wouldn’t be very interesting.

                    <p>
                        Compare the sentiments of movie and books, is to more or less look into the one-dimensional
                        mood-scale, considering happy verses sad. But the values found vary so little that there is not
                        much to be concluded, though the overall graphs can be justified with the events of the books.
                        The dataset used to calculate the sentiment, is not representative of the harry potter universe,
                        due to its unique world. Some strongly implicative words such as Dark Lord, Death Eaters and
                        Muggle have huge meanings in the wizarding world, they also highlight the importance of
                        neighbouring words, to the single words understanding. In any of the sentiment analysis, is so
                        tiny any form of analysis is borderline speculative, however we still intent to try as we have
                        found the results to fit very well with the material.
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="center">Book</h4>
                    <p>
                        This sentiment is calculated from the dialog from each movie. This was found to be the best
                        indicator, through testing, as a book contains large amount of descriptive text.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The graph nicely illustrates the how we experience the movies. The first is introduction to the
                        wizarding universe from the view of an 11 year old. It is magical and fantastic, and danger is
                        not really comprehensible. The stakes are higher in the second and third, where the danger
                        becomes life threatening. In Goblet of Fire we are once again introduced to something magical
                        and exciting. The fifth and sixth books both have both discouraging and encouraging plot lines
                        running in the books narrative. And as expected the seventh and last book Voldemort sends the
                        wizarding world into a downwards spiral, that Harry must save.

                    <p>
                        The sentiment analysis of the book chapters are also based of the dialog. Here the overall
                        development in sentiment is very linear. Keys events such as Dumbledore’s and the resurrection
                        of Voldemort clearly identifiable, oddly enough this does not apply to the dead of Sirius. The
                        second chapter in Goblet of Fire is entirely inner dialogue and description - aka. No dialog -
                        and thus has a sentiment of zero.

                    <p>
                        The sentiment is calculated for a full scene, stage directions and all, as it was very hard to
                        separate the dialog, reasons are listed in the Notebook. The average sentiment of the movies are
                        0.5 below that of the books, which would be interesting to further investigate. The drop in
                        Prisoner of Azkaban is due to a faulty scene. In Order of the Phoenix the sentiment is much
                        lower towards the end of the movie possibly indicating that the movie has better conveyed the
                        sad feeling of Harry because of Sirius’ murder. The death of Cedric and Dumbledore are however
                        not very clearly identifiable.
